# Amazon Prime Videos- Dashboard 

## Problem Statement

At Amazon Prime Video, an in-depth Power BI dashboard is needed to analyze the platform's content library comprehensively. This dashboard should highlight important metrics like the distribution of total shows by country, rating breakdown based on show numbers, total shows by release year, and more.

Presently, there is a lack of a centralized and user-friendly data visualization tool that can offer a holistic view of Amazon Prime Video's content, making it difficult to spot trends, patterns, and improvement opportunities.

The objective is to create a Power BI dashboard that can efficiently display the following details:
1. Breakdown of total shows by country: Understand the distribution of shows on Amazon Prime Video by their country of origin to showcase content diversity and popularity.

2. Rating distribution based on total shows: Visualize the ratings of shows based on the total number in each rating category (e.g., 5-star, 4-star) to gain insights into audience preferences and content quality.

3. Total shows categorized by release year: Display the distribution of shows by their release years to track content production trends and plan for future acquisitions.

4. Genre distribution: Present the distribution of shows across various genres to understand audience preferences and inform content acquisition and production decisions.

5. User engagement metrics: Include metrics like views, average watch time, and user ratings to measure audience engagement with Amazon Prime Video content.

### Steps followed 

To create an Amazon Prime Video dashboard on Power BI, you would need to follow these steps:

1. Data Extraction: Start by extracting the necessary data from Amazon Prime Video. This could include user engagement metrics, content performance, subscription data, and other relevant information.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the extracted data to remove any duplicates, errors, or irrelevant information. You may need to normalize the data and ensure it is in a format that can be easily analyzed.

3. Data Modeling: Create a data model that connects the different datasets and establishes relationships between them. This will allow you to generate insights and visualizations based on the data.

4. Visualization: Use Power BI's visualization tools to create the dashboard. You can include various visual elements such as charts, graphs, tables, and KPIs to represent the data in a meaningful way.

5. Design Layout: Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard in a logical and easy-to-understand manner. Consider using color coding, grouping related data, and adding interactive elements for a more user-friendly experience.

6. Data Analysis: Use Power BI's analytical capabilities to analyze the data and generate insights. You can create calculated fields, apply filters, and perform complex calculations to explore the data further.

7. Dashboard Publishing: Once the dashboard is ready, publish it on Power BI Service so that it can be accessed by other users. You can also schedule automatic data refreshes to keep the dashboard up to date.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive Amazon Prime Video dashboard on Power BI that provides valuable insights and helps in making informed business decisions.
